# Checkout

The **Checkout API** provides two types of checkout processes:

1. **Checkout Invoice** – Generates an invoice for the customer to complete the payment.
2. **Checkout Bank Invoice** – Generates an invoice with bank-specific payment instructions.

Both options allow merchants to create and manage payment transactions securely.
